# Better Working World Data Challenge

## Welcome!

This github repository has been created for participants in the Better Working World Data Challenge. The repository contains code and documentation used to set up and manage a data and analytics environment for completing the Challenge. 

To get started on the Challenge, read the [Welcome Booklet](https://rebrand.ly/EY-welcome-booklet) and then watch [From sign up to submission in 20 minutes flat on Microsoft Azure](https://youtu.be/FxCjDc0GRxI). If you are a student, be sure to [redeem your complementary Azure credits](https://github.com/EY-Data-Science-Program/2021-Better-Working-World-Data-Challenge/wiki/1a.-Creating-an-Azure-for-Students-subscription)! The credits are available even if you've previously had a Azure for Students account.

We encourage you to join the conversation on the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/EY-Data-Science-Program/2021-Better-Working-World-Data-Challenge/discussions) where you can submit questions if you need help.

## What technical support do you need?
We'd like to provide the best technical support available to help you complete the Challenge - [tell us about your technology setup](https://forms.office.com/r/CfvHqVtzW8) and any help you need so that we can tailor the resources we offer you.

## Contents

EY has been working closely with Geoscience Australia and Microsoft to provide a suitable environment for developing your solution to the Challenge. Check out the menu on the right to deploy your very own instance of the environment which contains all the data and technology you need.

* Section 1 covers getting set up with your analysis environment. This means creating the place where you will write your code and work on your solution to the Challenge. You have a couple of options depending on your preferred infrastructure. We recommend going with Azure.

* Section 2 covers using your environment, some best practices for teaming and competing in the Challenge.

* Section 3 covers managing your environment, including cost and resource management. This section is especially useful if you are using Azure.

* Section 4 covers troubleshooting. Weâ€™ll be continuously updating this section throughout the Challenge so check back here if you have any infrastructure or deployment related issues.

* Section 5 covers some additional options for advanced users. If you want to use services such as Azure Machine Learning, or do large file transfers to or from your environment check out this section.
