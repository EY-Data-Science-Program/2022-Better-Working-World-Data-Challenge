This section will teach you how to turn off Data Science VM to avoid run out of credits by implementing an auto-shutdown of your VM at specific times, e.g. after you have finished work. This helps you to save credits because VMs that are shut down are not charged on Azure. We strongly recommend that you apply auto-shutdown.


## Step 1. In your &#39;Cube InABox&#39; VM click in &#39;Auto-shutdown&#39;:

## Step 2. Fill in the required details.

We suggest 10:00pm as shutdown time, however you can choose a time that works for your work schedule. You can always &#39;stop&#39; your VM manually, but if you forget, your VM will be automatically shut down at 10:00pm thereby preventing the machine from running idle and using up your credits unnecessarily.
