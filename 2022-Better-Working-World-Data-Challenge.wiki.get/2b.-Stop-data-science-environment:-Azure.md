This guide shows you how to stop your data science VM. Stopping the VM helps you to save credits, because you are only charged for running VM.


Simply navigate to your data science VM called &#39;_CubeInABox-CPU-16GB_&#39; and click on &#39;Stop&#39;:

We recommend you to keep (reserve) your IP by checking in the check-box as below. Otherwise the VM might get a new IP address on restart. Reserving the IP means you can always use the same address to access your data science environment. There is only a small extra cost associated with this (roughly $1 per week; see  [here for details](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/pricing/details/ip-addresses/)).

Remember that you have to start the VM (by clicking on &#39;Start&#39;) before you want to use your data science VM again.
