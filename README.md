## Welcome to the 2022 Better Working World Data Challenge
If you are a university student, young professional with less than two years of experience or an EY employee looking to learn more about data science and are interested in building a sustainable future – join us as we ask:

**How do you protect biodiversity with the click of a button?**

Life in all its various forms is biodiversity. This variety of life is fundamental to the function of ecosystems, the health of forests – and even our prosperity. Help us build computational models to locate biodiversity, specifically frogs. Frogs are a go-to for scientists wanting to study the health of a particular ecosystem. The winning outputs will help scientists, policymakers and governments to protect and predict the richness of biodiversity in a specific area.

Join us to collectively help save the plants, animals and microorganisms that are critical to a healthy society and a thriving economy.

Choose from three available options, from beginner to advanced – all are welcome. Curated learning programs from EY, Data Camp and Microsoft to will help you prepare.
