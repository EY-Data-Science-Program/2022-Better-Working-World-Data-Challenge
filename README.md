## Welcome to the 2022 Better Working World Data Challenge
If you are a university student, young professional with less than two years of experience or an EY employee looking to learn more about data science and are interested in building a sustainable future – join us as we ask: **How do you protect biodiversity with the click of a button?**

Life in all its various forms is biodiversity. This variety of life is fundamental to the function of ecosystems, the health of forests – and even our prosperity. Help us build computational models to locate biodiversity, specifically frogs. Frogs are a go-to for scientists wanting to study the health of a particular ecosystem. The winning outputs will help scientists, policymakers and governments to protect and predict the richness of biodiversity in a specific area.

Join us to collectively help save the plants, animals and microorganisms that are critical to a healthy society and a thriving economy.

This Git repository contains various helpful resources for you to get started on Challenge 1 and 2 of the EY Better Working World Data Challenge 2022.
